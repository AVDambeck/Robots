free card game for two players

This is a card game I made in fall of 2019. It was meant to be the same kind of game as MTG or YuGiOh, but played with common playing cards instead of expensive trading cards. This does remove all of the deck building and collecting aspects. It is decently fun, but the main reason I'm making this repository is to explain the process behind making documents for the [zine machine](https://github.com/AVDambeck/Robots/edit/main/README.md).

# Making the Document
I made the document in LibreOffice (foss life) but any document program should work, and the core of the zine machine should work on any regular browser. 

## Page Formatting
First I set the page size very small. I live in the US, so regrettably I use letter paper, and not A4. The process is the same but the numbers are different. 

To maintain size through the project I set the page size to what it finally would be, 1/8th of a letter paper: 2.75" x 4.25". I set the margins very small, 0.1". You need a tiny bit of margin to keep the edges of letters safe, but you really don't need more than necessary. You could probably shave these a little smaller if you really needed that last bit of space.

## Text Formatting
In a single 8 fold zine, there really is not a lot of space. The text body is a very clear font, Matrix Book. It's only 11 point which is on the side for game instructions, and to fit all the text I had even squeezed the kerning (character spacing) down -0.3 pt. The paragraph spacing is also minimal, 0.02", with line spacing of only 110%. 

The key thing in mind is legibility. Font needs to be clearly seen even when struggling to hold the tiny zine. 

## Exporting
I simply exported it as a pdf, and split it into images using the script from the zine machine. LibreOffice does have a png export, but it only does a page at the time.
